# Clojure Lectures 

This is an example project I created for my students for them
to play with some aspects of clojure.

## Usage

The program requires some MIDI files to parse. I recommend the
[MIDI files](http://www.bachcentral.com/midiindexcomplete.html) for Bach's Fugues.
Then run

    $ lein run /MIDI/FILE/NAME instrument stretch-factor
